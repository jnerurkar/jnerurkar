## About Me

Hi, I'm Janvi 👋 

- I'm a data scientist with over 7 years of experience in healthcare-adjacent industries, and an avid solo traveler with over 5 years of experience.
- I'm currently searching for my next full-time gig. Feel free to reach out via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnerurkar/) if you'd like to connect!
- I'm hoping to revive my neglected GitHub profile with a series of projects in the near future. Stay tuned!
