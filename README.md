## About Me

Hi, I'm Janvi the Explorer ðŸ‘‹ 

- I'm a data scientist with over 7 years of experience in healthcare-adjacent industries, and an avid solo traveler with over 5 years of experience. 
- Venturing out into the unknown (messy data, uncharted territories, etc) happens to be my thing. Hence, "the Explorer"
- I'm currently searching for my next full-time gig. Feel free to reach out via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnerurkar/) if you'd like to connect!
- I'm in the process my neglected GitHub profile with a series of passion projects. Stay tuned!
